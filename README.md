# Customised Python Calculator

### The Design

* Colour
  * The colours I have chosen for the calculator is taken from my design for the age group
  * The **Website** that I used for this is: [**color pickers**](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPUK5QsQ=/#tpicker-content)

* Layout
  * Here's the link to my design in [**Miro**](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPUK5QsQ=/#tpicker-content)

* Development 
  * I developed my Calculator by testing different colours and designs to find the one that I thought was just right for my age range (8-10 years). 
  * I also changed around the buttons a lot to find a good layout.
